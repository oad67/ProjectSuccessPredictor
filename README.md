## This app predicts infrastructure project success or failure based on data from [The World Bank's PPI (Private Participation in Infrastructure) Database](https://ppi.worldbank.org/en/ppi). The data used in developing the predictive model included only that were not active (Status= Completed | Cancelled | Distressed). All completed projects were labeled as successful and the remaining were labeled as failed. Further enhancements to this tool will enable infrastructure investors to make informed and data-driven investment decisions on projects in low to upper middle income countries.
